Hi!

You'll notice the obvious lack of photos, this is because I am in fact a sasquatch and have the innate ability to not be taken photos of!

I'm an [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/0d33fe398bb9c) (put how much value you want on these tests :P I like them!) person. Always prefer quiet to chaos (but need chaor otherwise I just procastinate), always prefer non human interaction at shops, love being left alone. But I'll party with the best of them! (or used to...)

Music is very important to me, although I don't play any instrument (does middle school flute count? I can still play some notes :D).
Whenever I can I'm listening to something. Usually gravitate towards [Metal](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EQpgT26jgbgRI?si=bdc1f631dee344aa), specially [Symphonic Metal](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EIZ5s2nG9Fg6W?si=11ce89d733f24281) or [Alternative Metal](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E4jXFV0KMR1gU?si=5911486e26114256), and have a huge soft spot for [Orchestral Ambiance](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E4uKCMTxi0uJx?si=c68b7f17cfaf4161) (basically movie or game OSTs). Letely I've been listening to an Indian Folk Metal band called [Bloodywood](https://www.youtube.com/@Bloodywood). Check them out, it's really cool (I recommend starting with [Dana Dan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65A626Ed20))

Books are also important, but through the years I lost the habit of reading. Recently got really into using Audible, just fits better with my time management (doing the boring chores while "reading" a book).
My favourites will definitely be within the Fantasy realm (super natural / magic / worlds totally different from ours!) â€“ Like the The [Kingkiller Chronicle](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45262-the-kingkiller-chronicle). Recently I have been really into the the [The Demon Cycle](https://www.goodreads.com/series/46817-the-demon-cycle) and [Nightfall Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/321852-nightfall-saga) by Peter V. Brett.

Gamming has always been a big part of my life, my particular taste also gravitates to Fantasy, RPGs are of choice for gameplay.
Oblivion / Skyrim, The Witcher Series, Yakuza Series & related, Dragon Ball Z (Budoukai 1,2,3 and Tenkaichi 1,2,3, and just about anything with DBZ on the cover and says PlayStation 2), Counter Strike 1.6, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, etc...
Lost a lot of time with League of Legends, but was able to get rid of that drug!

Lately i've been playing a lot of [Civ6](https://civilization.2k.com/), [Cities Skylines](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about), [Baldurs Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/) and [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/pt/en/).

Movies follow the same formula as Music & Gaming. Gimme a Fantasy movie and I'm happy (SCI-FI as well :)).

Have you checked my [newsletter entry](http://gls-group.nst.gls-germany.com/NEWSLETTER/en/2021/september/my-chapter/rodrigo-lopes)? I would if I were you! Otherwise, let's take a 15 min in the [Cappuccino Room](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ab8dfc45823624a89bb0e6d846ddbed08%40thread.tacv2/Cappuccino%2520room?groupId=94a755ca-a579-4eec-b381-bd4738dbcd51&tenantId=e6170c30-202d-4926-b525-b8b882873f3b) so we can know each other better!!
